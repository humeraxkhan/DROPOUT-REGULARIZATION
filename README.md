# DROPOUT-REGULARIZATION
Brief README for Customer Churn Prediction

The Customer Churn Prediction project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras. The script includes data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and training a neural network for binary classification. It evaluates the model using metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix.
Brief README for Dropout Regularization

The Dropout Regularization project showcases the use of dropout layers to prevent overfitting in a neural network model. The model is trained on a sonar dataset to classify signals as either rock or mine. It compares performance with and without dropout regularization, using TensorFlow/Keras, and evaluates results using accuracy and classification reports.
